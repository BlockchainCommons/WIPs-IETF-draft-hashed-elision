1.  Introduction

   Current IETF guidelines for privacy and human rights considerations
   [RFC6973] in internet protocols lack the specificity needed for
   practical implementation, leading to privacy threats such as
   correlation, secondary use, and unnecessary disclosure of data.

   IETF released guidelines for privacy considerations in 2013 with RFC
   6973 and then expanded upon that with human-rights considerations in
   2017 with [RFC8280].  Both RFCs provide thoughtful ideas for how
   privacy can be improved in internet protocols, and how that can
   support human rights on the internet.

   However, as generalized guidelines the RFCs don’t provide the
   specifics that might be required to incorporate these guidelines into
   new protocols.  This document suggests more specific areas of work
   based in part on the Data Minimization suggestions of §6.1 of RFC
   6973, and expands them to also support some of the Human Rights
   Guidelines outlined in §6.2 of RFC 8280.

2.  Problem Statement

2.1.  Correlation, Secondary Use, and Disclosure All Threaten Privacy

   Often, digital data transmission operates on an all-or-nothing basis:
   sharing data means full disclosure.  This can threaten privacy in
   multiple ways:

   *  Correlation can combine data from different sources,
      unintentionally revealing comprehensive individual data,
      significantly more than was intended.  This is highlighted as a
      problem in S.5.2.1 of RFC 6973.

   *  Secondary Use permits data acquirers to repurpose it beyond its
      original intent.  This is highlighted as a problem in S.5.2.3 of
      RFC 6973.

   *  Disclosure of any sort can reveal more data than was required for
      a use, and that extra data can then create prejudice or otherwise
      disadvantage the individual whose data has been disclosed.  This
      is highlighted as a problem in S.5.2.4 of RFC 6973.

   Methodologies for minimizing the amount of data shared at any one
   time can reduce all of these privacy dangers.

2.2.  Data Minimization through Anonymity or Pseudonymity is
      Insufficient

   §6.1 of RFC 6973 lists anonymity and pseudonymity as two
   methodologies for creating data minimization.  This means removing
   uniquely identifying data and/or reducing the amount of personal data
   that is transmitted.

   Though anonymity and pseudonymity are minimal requirements for
   improving the privacy of digital data, they are insufficient.  To
   best address privacy requires reducing the amount of all data found
   in any disclosure to the bare minimum required for a specific
   disclosure.

2.3.  Simplistic Data Minimization Can Hinder Other Humans Rights
      Solutions

   Simplistic data minimization focuses on cutting out unnecessary
   content that is not required for a specific task.  Doing this is a
   necessity to improve privacy through data minimization, but again
   it’s not sufficient.

   This is because simplistic data minimization excises everything about
   data, which can cause problems for the Integrity and potentially the
   Authenticity of the original data set.  These are needed per the
   Guidelines for Human Rights, as outlined in §6.2.16 and §6.2.17 of
   RFC 8280.

   A better solution for data minimization is required, which does not
   ignore other Human Rights needs as it improves privacy.  Hashed data
   elision can provide such a solution.

2.4.  Any Data Can Be Too Much Data

   There are many situations where data minimization is important:
   because a party needs to know data that they do not previously know.
   However, there are other situations where a party doesn’t need to
   know some freeform data, but instead requires proof that a specific
   data precept is true.  The traditional example is proof whether
   someone is 21 or older, for buying alcohol in the US.

   In these cases, privacy threats can be reduced even more by providing
   no data, simply the proof that a certain precept is true.  This can
   offer very strong proof against Correlation (§5.2.1 of RFC 6973) and
   obviously minimizes Disclosure (§5.2.4 of RFC 6973).

   Though some systems such as BBS+ Signatures and other Zero Knowledge
   Proofs system can support superior anti-correlation with “proof of
   knowledge of the undisclosed signature”, a more simple salted hashed
   data elision often can provide easier solutions for many classes of
   “inclusion” proofs.

3.  Areas of Work

3.1.  Core Areas of Work

   This section tries to identify and structure areas of work to address
   the aforementioned topics by turning the guidelines of RFC 6973 and
   RFC 8280 into more precise specifications or requirements.  It
   focuses on hashed data elision as a core area of work, but in a
   section on optional areas of work discusses other advancements that
   can further support RFC 6973 and especially RFC 8280.

3.1.1.  Support Data Minimization

   As suggested by RFC 6973, Data Minimization is a prime methodology
   for improving privacy and reducing problems such as Correlation,
   Secondary Use, and Disclosure.

   To fully support Data Minimization, a specification must:

   1.  Allow for the elision of some content from a larger package of
       data.

   2.  Allow for the holder of that data to do that elision, rather than
       restricting it to only issuers.

3.1.2.  Incorporate Deterministic Hashing

   As noted in §2.3, above, simplistic Data Minimization can cause other
   human rights problems such as a lack of Authenticity or Integrity
   checking.  This can be resolved in a specification by requiring a
   fingerprint that can be used to verify elided data.  It must:

   1.  Allow elided data to be verified with a fingerprint.

   2.  Maintain the validity of authenticity checks such as signatures
       through that fingerprint.

   3.  Ensure that the fingerprint is unidirectional, so that the
       fingerprint can prove the existence of the data, but the data
       cannot be derived from the fingerprint.

   This can typically be done throug a hash function such as SHA-256 or
   a newer function such as BLAKE3.  Combined with the requirements of
   §3.1.1, above, it would require data to be hashed prior to its
   elision and for any signature to cover the hashes, not the unhashed
   data.

3.1.3.  Enable Inclusion Proofs

   Because data does not always need to be shared to provide the
   verification required by a validator, support of data proofs can
   provide additional privacy and human rights benefits.  To support
   this, a specification must:

   1.  Allow for the revelation of specific fingerprints.

   2.  Support the easy creation of an inclusion proof that demonstrate
       how specific data can be hashed to create that specific
       fingerprint.

   3.  Enable any holder to create that inclusion proof, not just an
       issuer.

   Through this methodology, a holder can create a proof for a specific
   bit of data, such as their residence in a specific country or state,
   demonstrate that proof’s creation, and show that it matches the hash
   of elided data.  However, the holder does so only if and when they
   wish: the data is never known unless they do so.

   Though other methodologies exist for proving the content of data,
   such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs and BBS+ Signatures, inclusion proofs
   based on hashes provide a much easier solution that is pragmatically
   more likely to be implemented and thus is more accessible and useable
   today.

3.1.4.  Facilitate Herd Privacy

   Support for inclusion proofs can also allow for the use of herd
   privacy, where data about a specific user is contained within a much
   larger hash of data, which can be widely published without danger.
   This puts all the agency for data revelation in an individual user’s
   hand, and does it without any need to “phone home”, meaning that not
   even the original publisher of the data would know when that data
   were being checked.

   To ensure that inclusion proofs can be extended to herd privacy, a
   specification must:

   1.  Use a branching structure for data storage such as a Merkle Tree
       where hashes can be further hashed together at high levels in a
       well-known, regularized way.

   2.  Allow for the publication of top-level or high-level hashes.

   3.  Enable individual holders to reveal paths that connect their
       individual data up to the top-level or high-level hash through
       any number of branches.

   4.  Build that structure in such a way that a minimum of other hashes
       are revealed when a user reveals a path to their own data; or
       else ensure that any other hashes revealed are worthless without
       knowledge of secret data, such as a salt.

   5.  Otherwise support the creation of inclusion proofs for proving
       their low-level individual data.

   Ensuring herd privacy in part focuses upon empowering the user, but
   it also depends on a thoughtful creation of the hash tree structure,
   such that other information can’t be guessed from the revelation of
   hashes.

3.2.  Optional Areas of Work

   Using hashed data elision as a foundation would improve the privacy
   of almost any IETF protocol.

   The Gordian Envelope Internet-Draft [GordianEnvelope] is one example
   of a specification that supports hashed data elision.  It could be
   used to enable all of the Core Areas of Work.  It also goes further,
   incorporating additional functionality that can provide better
   support for RFC 6973 and RFC 8280 through additional features,
   including the following.

3.2.1.  Extend Support to Encryption & Compression

   A hashed data elision system can be expanded to support both
   encryption and compression functions, as encrypted and compressed
   data can also be represented by their hashes without revealing any
   information about the original data.

   Incorporating encryption into a data specification offers the highest
   level of privacy and of data minimization possible, as data can only
   be viewed by select individual with the decryption key.  This is
   especially important for Confidentiality, which is referenced in
   §6.2.15 of RFC 8280.

   Hashing encryption primarily improves Authenticity, per §6.2.17 of
   RFC 8280.  As with other sorts of elided data, signatures will remain
   valid even following compression, provided the signatures are applied
   to the data hash, not the original data.

3.2.2.  Address Additional Human Rights Threats

   As currently imagined, the Gordian Envelope Internet Draft also
   offers support for several other Guidelines for Human Rights
   Considerations that are listed in §6.2 of RFC 8280:

   *  Privacy (S.6.2.2).  Besides the obvious privacy benefits of data
      minimization, Gordian Envelope also improves privacy through
      optional usage of metadata, which can be used to document the
      sensitivity of contents, retention limits, etc.

   *  Accessibility (S.6.2.11).  Metadata can also be used to ensure
      accessibility and internationalization of data through inclusions
      of references with a variety of localizations.

   *  Censorship Resistance (S.6.2.6).  Gordian Envelope is built to
      support SCIDs, or self-certifying identifiers, which can be used
      to avoid reuse of existing identifiers that might be associated
      with persons or content.

   *  Open Standards (S.6.2.7).  As an Internet Draft, Gordian Envelope
      represents an open standard.  It can support interoperable
      exchange of data, which is vital for human rights.

   *  Heterogeneity Support (S.6.2.8), Adaptability (S.6.2.18).  Gordian
      Envelope builds its data format on triples: assertions of
      subjects, predicates, and objects.  This format can easily be
      adapted to a wide variety of data formatting styles.

   *  Localization (S.6.2.12), Decentralization (S.6.2.13).  As an open
      standard that solely utilizes other open standards such as well-
      known hashing and encryption algorithms, Gordian Envelope is built
      to avoid decentralization.  This is further supported by Gordian
      Envelope's Heterogeneity Support, its Adaptability, and its
      Reliability.

   *  Reliability (S.6.2.14), Integrity (S.6.2.16).  Gordian Envelope is
      built on CBOR, which means that data is self-describing.  It is
      also hashed.  This improves its Reliability and Integrity, while
      the self-description also makes data stored in Gordian Envelope
      more interoperable, and thus less subject to centralization.

3.2.3.  Keep It Simple

   Support for privacy and for human rights has another requirement: it
   needs to be kept simple so that it finds actual use.

   Gordian Envelope [GordianEnvelope] is a fundamentally simple data
   format that only achieves complexity through iterative structure
   design.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   As outlined, the concept of hashed data elision and, more
   specifically the Gordian Envelope specification, provide a wide
   variety of privacy advancements.

   The biggest remaining privacy concern is of accidental correlation
   that can arise if different parties have different versions of the
   same data, which has been elided in different ways.  This is
   currently seen as an acceptable side-effect of an elision system that
   allows for Authenticity and Integrity in the system, and can be
   offset by careful creation of Envelope structures, such as gathering
   small groups of data into distinct, elided branches.

   However, the question also remains open as to whether there might be
   more expansive and more automated solutions.

5.  Security Considerations

   The biggest security considerations focus on the strength of hashing
   algorithms (and encryption algorithms if they’re used).  Potential
   threats to hashes and encryption such as quantum computing would also
   result in threats to any hashed data elision system.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is separately being queried on the allocation of certain CBOR
   tags for IANA.
